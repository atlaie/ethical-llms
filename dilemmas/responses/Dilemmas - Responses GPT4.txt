Response 2: In a moral decision, both intentions and consequences matter, but the consequences of the actions carry more weight in the context of saving human lives.

Response 

1: The community should seek a balance between collective good and individual liberties, recognizing the importance of personal aspirations alongside collective needs.

Response 2: Onyx should have the freedom to pursue personal opportunities, but it is also valuable to consider how their contribution to the local project can be replaced or deferred to minimize impact on the common good.
